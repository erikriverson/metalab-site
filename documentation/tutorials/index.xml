&lt;div id=&#34;building-a-ma&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Building a MA&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-do-i-define-my-ma-question&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do I define my MA question?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0TVSjaRsfGU&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose the appropriate level of detail for your MA topic. The topic of your meta-analysis should be broader than the one of a single experiment (e.g. “How do babies segment words of different stress patterns?”), but narrower than a whole research field (e.g. “How do babies learn language?”). The goal is to be able to gather comparable papers, measuring consistant dependant variables, to allow you to compute a common statistical metric (i.e. effect size) from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define your population of interest precisely. Homogeneous can mean many things; age, language, typical versus atypical. You may run a meta-analysis where you accept many different levels for some of the variables and see how it affects results, defining them as MA moderators, for example seeing if effects are consistent across ages. There should still be some unifying element in your studies though so you have one broad result of your meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the number of available studies on your topic. Your MA topic also depends on how many studies have been done on it. If you want to run a simple comparative MA, as few as two studies could be okay. But if you want to run an analysis with a lot of moderators, 5 studies probably isn’t enough to warrant a meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;why-should-i-bother-keeping-track-of-the-ma-creation-process&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why should I bother keeping track of the MA creation process?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FPlKC2feqNo&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important that you build traceability of your work from the start,
particularly since in larger MAs other people may finish up the
work or you want to check later on why you decided to exclude a given
paper. So to make sure that all of your decisions are recorded and
clear, make a copy of this &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mtN4g6FddpBljQzrR-mS0y414M9wQNjK4Vz09nLOe2s/edit#gid=0&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;decision
spreadsheet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Don???t forget to rename it, to give us a ???viewing??? link, and clean it up
as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Click on ???File??? and select the ???Make a copy?????? option&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;media/image04.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:4.27557in;height:3.20313in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2: In the window that appears, change the name to something like
???MA_TOPIC&#34;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;media/image03.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:4.58854in;height:3.39219in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Click on the blue button ???Share??? on the top right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 4: In the ensuing menu, click on ???Get shareable link??? on the top
right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 5: Copy the link and send it to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;media/image05.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:5.2203in;height:3.73438in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 6: Clean up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model spreadsheet contains some fake entries and notes. Our
recommendation is, so as not to get confused, to remove the instructions
found on the top lines of each sheet and the fake information that is
already entered - except for a couple of exceptions: the pink columns
(A, B and W) in the Relevant_studies_search sheet contain formulas
that may be useful to you. So you might want to delete the contents of
the other columns and keep those two in order to reuse the formulas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, make a copy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DKY8BTZZ82bGyGwpGsyyzsilOqE1F1NcDLTKWtCe9AY/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;this
flowchart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
rename and share as you did for your spreadsheet above. This figure
gives you an overview of the process, and you will be filling in the
boxes with the right numbers as you go along so that people who continue
this MA and/or those interested in assessing this work can make sure
that you followed the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;now-that-i-have-my-list-of-related-studies-should-i-enter-all-of-them-in-my-ma&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Now that I have my list of related studies, should I enter all of them in my MA?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gk3GHT_eEI8&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not. In this step, you will go through the initial list you put together in
step 2, and make decisions to include/exclude papers, mostly based on
the abstract. In addition to creating your sample for data entry (step
4) you will start honing your &lt;em&gt;inclusion criteria&lt;/em&gt;. Typically, these
will include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a homogeneous scientific question&lt;/strong&gt;:
&amp;gt; Make sure you have clearly
&amp;gt; defined the purview of e.g. cross-situational learning (e.g., this
&amp;gt; name itself is vague to those outside the domain, so define it in
&amp;gt; a more specific way: ???exposure to sets of images paired with
&amp;gt; wordforms with the goal of studying word-form image association,
&amp;gt; but crucially multiple images are shown at once (unlike e.g. the
&amp;gt; switch procedure)???)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a homogeneous infant population&lt;/strong&gt;:
&amp;gt; Typically-developing children,
&amp;gt; between the ages of XX and YY (the precise ages may stem from your
&amp;gt; seminal paper; perhaps to start with, you could set the maximum to
&amp;gt; 36 months, the minimum to 0 months); consider whether you also
&amp;gt; need to restrict the sample based on infants??? native language &lt;em&gt;on
&amp;gt; theoretical reasons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last one is perhaps the trickiest: How broadly should you be in terms of method,
simuli, and other methodological details? The advantage of being picky is that
all the results will be structured in similar ways.
But this may be a source of bias. For
instance, you could decide that you will only input data using a
specific kind of artificial language because you know that papers not
using this language have smaller effects. This will end up being a
self-confirmation exercise – unless there are a priori strong
theoretical reasons to exclude other kinds of language, or to assume
that the learning algorithms attributed to the infant cannot be
generalized to these other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you make a decision regarding these and other key criteria,
remember to note it in your decision spreadsheet, in the last sheet
called ???Notes_inclusion???. For example, mine looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width=&#34;19%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;col width=&#34;74%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;col width=&#34;6%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a homogeneous scientific question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;learning of speech sound categories, where the categories are represented by a multimodal versus unimodal distribution of acoustic correlates&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10/19/2015&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a homogeneous infant population&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;typically-developing children, between the ages of 0 and 36 months&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10/19/2015&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a homogeneous procedure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;passive exposure in the lab, testing via any behavioral or non-behavioral method&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10/19/2015&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-do-i-select-the-studies-to-include&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do I select the studies to include ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/W3LMs-XY21g&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this step is to put together a list of publications that you
will look at (abstract only in step 3, and for a subset of those in full
in step 4) and consider for inclusion. In a typical MA, you make the
most comprehensive list possible in order to answer a specific research
question and/or to cover a given phenomenon. This typically means going
through 1,000 abstracts, and reading in full 100 papers.
You can start with the seminal paper for your effect of interest, and then look for the studies citing your seminal one. Use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/advanced&#34;&gt;pubmed???s search&lt;/a&gt; to find your pivot study???s entry, for instance by copy-pasting the full paper title in the builder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;media/pubmed_advanced_search.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you press ???search???, usually you???ll find the entry for your seminal paper (or if the title was not unique, you might need to click on one of the entries found until you do come across the entry for your seminal paper). Notice on the right a section entitled ???Cited by ?????? Scroll down to click on the link at the bottom of this section stating ???See all..???&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;media/pubmed_citing_papers.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will now see all studies citing your seminal one. Constrain it further by clicking on ???Show additional filters??? on the left, and checking the box for ???Infant: birth to 23 months???:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;media/links_from_pubmed.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now want to save all these papers in your reference management software.
If you use Zotero: Click on the drawing of a folder in your status/search bar. When you do so, a window will pop up with all the results for that pubmed page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;media/save2Zotero.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on ???select all??? and ???OK???. Repeat for the other search pages. This will store the citation information, including abstract, in zotero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also interrogate Pubmed with a script, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/mcfrank/c1ec74df1427278cbe53&#34;&gt;the one we have prepared&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-exactly-can-i-go-about-looking-through-my-initial-list-and-making-decisions&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How exactly can I go about looking through my initial list and making decisions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zBn83RQlo-c&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if the title and abstract doesn???t allow me to decide?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then play it safe and include the paper to check based on the full text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if the title and abstract doesn???t allow me to decide, but in
fact I know the paper and I know it needs to be excluded?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you probably have already seen the full text of the paper, so say
???yes??? for the screening decision, and then ???no??? for the full-text
decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-many-papers-should-i-enter&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How many papers should I enter?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you would enter everything: published or unpublished, proceedings or journal, etc. However, sometimes you may want to start a ???seed??? meta-analysis that just gives a rough idea of an area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, how large should your sample be? Mika and Molly have done some &lt;a href=&#34;https://rawgit.com/langcog/metalab/master/resampling/resampling.html&#34;&gt;simulations&lt;/a&gt; to help you decide. By and large, it looks like the more, the better - clearly estimates get more precise (confidence intervals narrow) as more papers are entered. Based on this information, we are proposing &lt;em&gt;a minimum of 10 included experiments&lt;/em&gt; as a pragmatic first step, knowing that your estimate is not very precise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-should-i-structure-the-data-for-my-ma&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How should I structure the data for my MA?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hoping that eventually all of these MAs may be included in
&lt;a href=&#34;.&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;MetaLab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so we ask you to use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Y_2BcFSu48t0F8a_xrY1Ro2fJoCIV1h8O627WNcrjY/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;MA
template&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
(create a copy, as you did in step 1), and follow the &lt;a href=&#34;/documentation.html#field_specs&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;field specifications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Ideally, you would code all potentially relevant moderator variables
(e.g., experimental manipulations) in addition to the core
characteristics (columns in red; e.g. means). However, in the interest
of time, you can get started with the core characteristics only.
Remember once more to give us viewing rights (see step 1 for
instructions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-are-the-relevant-variables-for-a-ma-and-how-many-input-rowscolumns-should-i-make&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the relevant variables for a MA, and how many input rows/columns should I make?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/spge3nZqCng&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some FAQs we have received on this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of my papers has a single experiment but involves both Spanish and English speakers who are tested on a native and a nonnative speech sound contrast. Should that count as 4 experiments (2 languages x 2 contrasts)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many rows you make depends on how the results are reported. In this case, the authors report the outcome separately for all four groups. Therefore, please enter the four groups separately; each into their own row. You can copy over descriptions of the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Experiment 1, there are two age groups. Do I have to report the age for both groups or do I average both groups into one? If I have to report both groups, how do I report this in the input form?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many rows you make depends on how the results are reported. In this case, the authors report an average outcome over both age groups, since they did not find a significant difference between the two groups. Therefore, please enter only one row and calculate the average age. If the results were reported separately per age group, make a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-do-i-retrieve-studies&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do I retrieve studies?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a typical full MA, you go through the whole list and only then start
entering. The procedure is as follows. Go back to your spreadsheet, and
for each study that has been decided as a ???yes??? during screening, try to
retrieve the full text for the paper as you normally would (e.g., search
through scholar.google.com; regular google; your institution???s library,
etc.) If you cannot retrieve it, update your spreadsheet sheet
Relevant_studies_search to mark this paper as ???no??? in column F
entitled ???Fulltext_retrieved???. If you want, you can contact the authors
to try to get the full text from them, in which case you can note this
on column G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do find the full text, go through the paper to find the first
experiment reported. You will enter all experiments and conditions one
at a time, and fill in their information in the MA spreadsheet you
created in step 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-do-i-enter-and-code-relevant-studies&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do I enter and code relevant studies?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ5m5YZE57M&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT: You should work backwards from the &lt;strong&gt;results&lt;/strong&gt; section: look
at what dependent measures are reported fully enough that you will be
able to extract an effect size from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following information
allows one to calculate an effect size (we are sticking to experimental
designs, since most of our MAs are experimental):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;between-participant studies&lt;/strong&gt;:
&amp;gt; Means and SDs (not SEs!) of the
&amp;gt; dependent variable for each infant group** are all that is
&amp;gt; required for the calculation of Cohen’s d. Sometimes, means and
&amp;gt; SDs are not available as numbers. If there are clear figures, you
&amp;gt; can try to estimate means and SDs using** &lt;a href=&#34;http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this online
&amp;gt; app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;*. If you decide to
&amp;gt; estimate values from figures, add a column to keep track of this.
&amp;gt; Finally, &lt;strong&gt;t or F values for the &lt;em&gt;main&lt;/em&gt; effect in combination with
&amp;gt; sample sizes&lt;/strong&gt; can be used to calculate Cohen’s d. Note them
&amp;gt; when available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;within-participant studies&lt;/strong&gt;:
&amp;gt; Effect sizes for this type of
&amp;gt; study are calculated the &lt;strong&gt;same way as in between-participant
&amp;gt; studies&lt;/strong&gt;, but in order to calculate the weight of these studies
&amp;gt; the &lt;strong&gt;correlation&lt;/strong&gt; between the first and second measurements is
&amp;gt; required (to account for the amount of
&amp;gt; within-participant variation). Since this measure is usually not
&amp;gt; reported, we provide below median and range for correlations found
&amp;gt; in existing MAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infant word segmentation from native speech: 0.641 (range: 0.140 to 0.921)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infant vowel discrimination (native and nonnative): 0.496 (range: -0.413 to 0.855)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When entering papers, please remember a key thing: all analyses are done
by machines, and machines cannot read text! So if a column is ???numeric???,
please do &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; enter things that aren???t numbers (such as text,
spaces, ~, etc). This is particularly important for the dependent
measures!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage, you might find that a given paper does not contain the
right information for being included. In this case, you can and should
exclude it. If you have already started entering it, you can leave the
information you entered and put in ???comments??? that the entry is
incomplete (although if you followed our advice above, you won???t have
wasted time entering it!). Remember to update your spreadsheet with each
paper you read and made a decision on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The article I enter has 3 experiments, and the first is with adult participants. Do I need to enter this experiment?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, please only enter the infant/child experiments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-level-of-detail-should-i-report&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What level of detail should I report?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sound stimuli differ approx. 6 ms in length, but the experiment is not about length differences. Do I have to report this difference although it is very small?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case there???s a column for stimulus length, please report it. You are right that this experiment is not about length differences, but having the information cannot hurt, and eventual analyses will reflect that the difference is very small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The article reports a table with the lengths of each individual stimulus. Should I calculate and report the average value?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, please report the averaged value in the appropriate column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am entering an article with the HAS method. The authors report results for both the 2 and 4 minutes after the test phase has started. Your example only reports the results after 2 minutes, but would you still want me to report both?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often the case that articles report more than one type of result. Please just report the ones that we also provide in the example file!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-do-i-calculate-effect-sizes&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do I calculate Effect Sizes?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WDxA8TfU1sk&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use R to calculate effect sizes. Visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/langcog/metalab2&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://github.com/langcog/metalab2&lt;/a&gt; for our code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend the following for an introduction to effect sizes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Textbooks are great to get a basic overview of how to calculate
effect sizes. We consulted: Lipsey, M. W. &amp;amp; Wilson, D. B. (2001).
Practical meta-analysis. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. A great primer and a spreadsheet document to calculate effect sizes
by hand can be found via: D. Lakens. (2013). Calculating and Reporting
Effect Sizes to Facilitate Cumulative Science: A Practical Primer for
t-tests and ANOVAs . Frontiers in Psychology 4:863. Material:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/ixgcd/files/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;osf.io/ixgcd/files/&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Since textbooks do not cover every possible question that different
meta-analysts may encounter, we turned to articles for more specific
questions. We found this article useful for considering the
comparability of effect sizes from within- and between-participant
designs: Morris, S. B., &amp;amp; DeShon, R. P. (2002). Combining Effect Size
Estimates in Meta-Analysis With Repeated Measures and Independent-Groups
Designs. Psychological Methods, 7(1), 1805-125. doi:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//1082-989X.7.1.105&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;10.1037//1082-989X.7.1.105
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-to-run-a-meta-analytic-regression&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to run a meta-analytic regression ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VvP2DMLCRjU&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-if-i-dont-have-all-the-required-information&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What if I don???t have all the required information?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UPLhl32YBU4&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two groups of infants are tested and I treat them as two different entries, but the number of included and excluded infants are only reported as a whole over both groups. What do I do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the best approximation we can get, please divide the reported number through the number of groups (in your case 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The age of infants is reported in weeks, therefore I multiplied it with 7 to convert it into days. I read in your instructions that you have to multiply months with 30.42 to get a proxy for days. So my question is whether I have to multiply with a different number than 7 to get a proxy for days?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, that’s fine the way you did it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases you will still need to contact the authors of the study. People probably don???t know you, so think about what in the object would make you open an email from a stranger. Something like ???including your paper in a MA??? should be motivational. People are busy: they don???t have time to read lengthy email, especially from someone they don???t know, so be as concise as possible. You could still give them more details later if they ask for it. Don???t be shy, authors are likely to be happy to hear that someone is interested in their work and is going to cite them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;choosing-the-right-ma-question&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Choosing the right MA question&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-do-i-define-my-ma-question&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do I define my MA question?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/0TVSjaRsfGU&#34; width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose the appropriate level of detail for your MA topic. The topic of your meta-analysis should be broader than the one of a single experiment (e.g. “How do babies segment words of different stress patterns?”), but narrower than a whole research field (e.g. “How do babies learn language?”). The goal is to be able to gather comparable papers, measuring consistant dependant variables, to allow you to compute a common statistical metric (i.e. effect size) from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Define your population of interest precisely. Homogeneous can mean many things; age, language, typical versus atypical. You may run a meta-analysis where you accept many different levels for some of the variables and see how it affects results, defining them as MA moderators, for example seeing if effects are consistent across ages. There should still be some unifying element in your studies though so you have one broad result of your meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the number of available studies on your topic. Your MA topic also depends on how many studies have been done on it. If you want to run a simple comparative MA, as few as two studies could be okay. But if you want to run an analysis with a lot of moderators, 5 studies probably isn’t enough to warrant a meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;why-should-i-bother-keeping-track-of-the-ma-creation-process&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why should I bother keeping track of the MA creation process?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FPlKC2feqNo&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important that you build traceability of your work from the start,
particularly since in larger MAs other people may finish up the
work or you want to check later on why you decided to exclude a given
paper. So to make sure that all of your decisions are recorded and
clear, make a copy of this &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mtN4g6FddpBljQzrR-mS0y414M9wQNjK4Vz09nLOe2s/edit#gid=0&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;decision
spreadsheet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Don’t forget to rename it, to give us a “viewing” link, and clean it up
as follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Click on “File” and select the “Make a copy…” option&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;media/image04.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:5in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2&lt;/strong&gt;: In the window that appears, change the name to something like
“MA_TOPIC”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;media/image03.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:5in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Click on the blue button “Share” on the top right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4&lt;/strong&gt;: In the menu, click on “Get shareable link” on the top
right&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5&lt;/strong&gt;: Copy the link and send it to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;media/image05.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:5in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 6: Clean up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model spreadsheet contains some fake entries and notes. Our
recommendation is, so as not to get confused, to remove the instructions
found on the top lines of each sheet and the fake information that is
already entered - except for a couple of exceptions: the pink columns
(A, B and W) in the Relevant_studies_search sheet contain formulas
that may be useful to you. So you might want to delete the contents of
the other columns and keep those two in order to reuse the formulas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;************&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, make a copy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DKY8BTZZ82bGyGwpGsyyzsilOqE1F1NcDLTKWtCe9AY/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;this
flowchart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
rename and share as you did for your spreadsheet above. This figure
gives you an overview of the process, and you will be filling in the
boxes with the right numbers as you go along so that people who continue
this MA and/or those interested in assessing this work can make sure
that you followed the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;now-that-i-have-my-list-of-related-studies-how-do-i-set-my-inclusion-criteria&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Now that I have my list of related studies, how do I set my inclusion criteria?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gk3GHT_eEI8&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not. In this step, you will go through the initial list you put together in
step 2, and make decisions to include/exclude papers, mostly based on
the abstract. In addition to creating your sample for data entry (step
4) you will start honing your &lt;em&gt;inclusion criteria&lt;/em&gt;. Typically, these
will include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a homogeneous scientific question&lt;/strong&gt;:
&amp;gt; Make sure you have clearly
&amp;gt; defined the purview of e.g. cross-situational learning (e.g., this
&amp;gt; name itself is vague to those outside the domain, so define it in
&amp;gt; a more specific way: “exposure to sets of images paired with
&amp;gt; wordforms with the goal of studying word-form image association,
&amp;gt; but crucially multiple images are shown at once (unlike e.g. the
&amp;gt; switch procedure)”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a homogeneous infant population&lt;/strong&gt;:
&amp;gt; Typically-developing children,
&amp;gt; between the ages of XX and YY (the precise ages may stem from your
&amp;gt; seminal paper; perhaps to start with, you could set the maximum to
&amp;gt; 36 months, the minimum to 0 months); consider whether you also
&amp;gt; need to restrict the sample based on infants’ native language &lt;em&gt;on
&amp;gt; theoretical reasons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last one is perhaps the trickiest. Staying close to your seminal
paper will allow you to reduce the amount of variation in your sample
due to methodological “details”, and to make it easier for yourself to
enter data, because all the results will be structured in similar ways.
But it’s important to know that this is a potential source of bias. For
instance, you could decide that you will only input data using a
specific kind of artificial language because you know that papers not
using this language have smaller effects. This will end up being a
self-confirmation exercise – unless there are a priori strong
theoretical reasons to exclude other kinds of language or to assume
that the learning mechanisms attributed to the infant cannot be
generalized to these other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time you make a decision regarding these and other key criteria,
remember to note it in your decision spreadsheet, in the last sheet
called “Notes_inclusion”. For example, mine looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width=&#34;19%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;col width=&#34;74%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;col width=&#34;6%&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;header&#34;&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decision&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a homogeneous scientific question&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;learning of speech sound categories, where the categories are represented by a multimodal versus unimodal distribution of acoustic correlates&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10/19/2015&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;even&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a homogeneous infant population&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;typically-developing children, between the ages of 0 and 36 months&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10/19/2015&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class=&#34;odd&#34;&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a homogeneous procedure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;passive exposure in the lab, testing via any behavioral or non-behavioral method&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10/19/2015&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;div id=&#34;contribute-your-meta-analysis&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Contribute your meta-analysis&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have already done a meta-analysis, you can easily add it to MetaLab. This tutorial explains how. But first, we go over why this is good for you and the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;why-should-i-contribute-my-meta-analysis-to-metalab&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Why should I contribute my meta-analysis to MetaLab?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributing to MetaLab can have several advantages both for you and the community:&lt;br /&gt;
* &lt;strong&gt;Get more visibility for your MA.&lt;/strong&gt; When publishing a paper, you wish that it will be read by as many people as possible. Placing it in a centralized repository such as MetaLab can help you to reach this broad audience and gives more visibility to your meta-analysis.&lt;br /&gt;
* &lt;strong&gt;Increase the impact of your MA.&lt;/strong&gt; As an author, you probably want your results to be fully understood by readers, and you want your readers to use your data as efficiently as possible. The interactive interface of the MetaLab website allows readers to better navigate in your meta-analysis results than the paper version, and to play with the results to better use them when planning experiments. MetaLab is an opportunity for your meta-analysis to make a stronger impact.&lt;br /&gt;
* &lt;strong&gt;Contribute to drawing the broader developmental picture.&lt;/strong&gt; You made a meta-analysis to help the community draw a clearer picture about an effect of interest and contribute to theory assessment. MetaLab is a central platform that includes over 1040 effect sizes. Incorporating your meta-analysis in this larger dataset helps the community to have a better idea of cognitive development and language acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;who-owns-the-data-contributed-to-metalab&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who owns the data contributed to MetaLab?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You remain the owner of your meta-analysis data: Users must cite your data by your preferred citation. If your data are previously unpublished then this doesn’t count as publication. Learn more by reading our &lt;a href=&#34;/publications.html&#34;&gt;full citation policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;can-i-retain-control-on-my-data-must-i-forever-retain-control-of-my-data&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Can I retain control on my data? Must I forever retain control of my data?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can retain control for as long as you want to. In fact, two options exists for the curation and review of your data. You can &lt;strong&gt;choose to be the curator&lt;/strong&gt;. This means you agree to be the person responsible for identifying new relevant papers and signaling them to the MetaLab data manager, who will add them to the database of the relevant MA. You would be expected to check data entry once in a while. Curators are part of the MetaLab board and get informed of discussions regarding e.g. site revamping. Alternatively, you can &lt;strong&gt;choose to step down completely&lt;/strong&gt;, and it will be MetaLab’s job to assign a new curator for your dataset. In this case, we can still keep your photo on the wall of fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-do-i-code-my-existing-meta-analysis-in-the-metalab-format&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do I code my existing meta-analysis in the MetaLab format ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prepared a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Y_2BcFSu48t0F8a_xrY1Ro2fJoCIV1h8O627WNcrjY/edit#gid=0&#34;&gt;spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; that you must use to code your data. The key property of this spreadsheet is that it has one row for each effect size. Therefore you should fill as many rows as the number of effect size you report in your meta-analysis.&lt;br /&gt;
* The first tab, called “Data”, should contain your data.&lt;br /&gt;
* The second tab, called “CodeBook”, contains all the explanations about the codes to be used when you fill the “Data” tab.&lt;br /&gt;
* The third tab, called “Methods”, contains all the possible options for the “method” column and their respective description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow these steps to convert your data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a copy of the spreadsheet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rename the copy with an informative name to identify your MA: FirstAuthor_Topic (e.g. Dunst_motionese_preference).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a new tab and copy-paste your data table there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a copy of the “Data” tab to keep an interim version of your data.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the first column of the tab containing your data table. Then go to the new “InterimData” tab and paste your first column in the MetaLab column that matches.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat step 5 for each column of your data table.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the first column of the “InterimData” in the “Data” tab. Then edit each cell to match the data format specified in the “CodeBook” tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you work from your paper, you may have an appendix or a table for each of your moderators. In this case, take them one by one and follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a tab and copy-paste your appendix or table there. Check that the content of your appendix hasn’t been messed up when pasting. Rename the tab with the name of your moderator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit the data to have one row per effect size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have several tables/appendix, repeat step 1-2 for each of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have several appendix create another tab and copy paste the content of all appendix-specific tabs side-by-side to check that all lines match up (i.e. same number of effect sizes in all the appendix/tables).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have synthesized all your appendix in one table, copy-paste the column corresponding to a MetaLab requirement in the “Data” tab and edit each cell to match the data format specified in the “CodeBook” tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-if-an-effect-size-is-computed-with-groups-from-two-different-papers&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What if an effect size is computed with groups from two different papers ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write the two references in each of the first three columns (study_ID, long_cite, short_cite), separated by commas. The “short cite columns” should be in the text citation format, i.e. Smith (2002, 2008), if the two papers are from the same authors.
Fill the other columns as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-if-i-dont-have-all-the-columns-required-by-metalab&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What if I don’t have all the columns required by MetaLab ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fill the missing columns with “NA”. If it happens that you don’t have one of the mandatory columns, please &lt;a href=&#34;metalab-project@googlegroups.com&#34;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-types-of-communications-are-considered-as-peer-reviewed&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What types of communications are considered as peer-reviewed ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most journal articles are peer-reviewed; some conference proceedings (e.g., Cognitive Science) are peer-reviewed. Typically, book chapters, posters, and conference abstract are not considered peer-reviewed because no reviewer has seen the full details of the methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;contribution-challenge-2020&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contribution Challenge 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To celebrate the latest (ongoing) upgrade and the inclusion of 25 meta-analyses to date, the MetaLab team with support of the Fetzer Franklin Fund is organizing a challenge for authors of meta-analyses on cognitive development (data challenge) and for contributors of shiny apps (code challenge). The contribution challenge will offer three $1,000 US in cash prizes distributed between (teams of) authors or coders, who contribute meta-analysis data to the MetaLab database or, who make substantial contributions to the site, for example proposing and implementing a shiny app providing a new analysis or functionality in coordination with the MetaLab team. Deadline is 2020-10-15 (15 October).
You can find more information here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://bit.ly/MetaLabChallenge2020&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://bit.ly/MetaLabChallenge2020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;contribution-challenge-2018&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contribution Challenge 2018&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MetaLab challenge calling for meta-analyses on cognitive development, with support from Berkeley Initiative for Transparency in the Social Sciences (BITSS), has closed. We received data for 7 meta-analyses, which will be added to MetaLab in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winners are three early career researchers: Angeline Tsui (Ottawa / Stanford), M. Julia Carbajal (LSCP Paris), and Katie Von Holzen (LPP Paris / Maryland).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angeline Tsui contributed data on a meta-analysis of the “Switch Task”, a key paradigm in language acquisition research. In a switch task infants are taught new labels for unknown objects (such as “lif” vs “neem”). Their knowledge is then tested by whether they can detect the switching of the word-object pairings (calling the “lif” now “neem”). Results from switch task studies raised the possibility that there are differences in infants’ abilities to distinguish speech sounds in a pure speech perception task (where no visual information giving cues to the referent is presented) versus in a word learning context, and led to a string of follow-up studies that are synthesized in this meta-analysis. Angeline’s paper describing the meta-analysis in more detail is currently under review in Developmental Psychology (&lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/uwe8g/&#34;&gt;Preprint&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;M. Julia Carbajal conducted a meta-analysis on infants’ ability to distinguish frequent from rare words (like “hello” versus “hallux”) when these words are just presented via a speech stream without visual referents. In this type of studies, researchers typically compare how long infants like to listen to different word lists (one with very frequent and one with very rare words), which is an easy to apply but very indirect measure. Studies on infants’ ability to distinguish those word lists were the first to establish when infants begin to systematically learn words in their native language, albeit with varying results across studies. It was thus a good moment to estimate the meta-analytic effect size. The paper on this meta-analysis is currently in preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katie Von Holzen’s meta-analysis (conducted in collaboration with MetaLab team member Christina Bergmann, which led to 50% of her data being discounted) addresses infants’ sensitivity to mispronunciations (for example, whether “tog” is a good label for “dog”). Dealing with mispronunciations is another key skill in language acquisition and processing, and the meta-analysis aims to show whether infants become more strict or more lenient with experience as to how a word should sound. A short report on the meta-analysis is appearing in the Proceedings of the Cognitive Science Society Conference (&lt;a href=&#34;http://osf.io/nvc8m&#34;&gt;Preprint&lt;/a&gt;), a full-length paper is in preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would also like to specifically highlight the contribution of Hugh Rabagliati, Brock Ferguson, and Casey Lew-Williams, who would have been among the winners based on their contribution, but generously stepped down to leave the prize for an early career researcher. The meta-analysis they contributed addresses how infants can learn rules that are implicit in their environment. Their open access &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/desc.12704&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; just appeared in the journal Developmental Science (Rabagliati, H., Ferguson, B., &amp;amp; Lew-Williams, C. (2018). “The profile of abstract rule learning in infancy: Meta-analytic and experimental evidence”. Developmental Science, DOI: &lt;a href=&#34;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/desc.12704&#34;&gt;10.1111/desc.12704&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who participated in our challenge. MetaLab continues to be open for submissions, we provide further information on the Tutorials page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;data-sharing-policy&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Data-sharing policy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta-analyses will be added to the MetaLab online database. Users will be able to download your data and potentially re-use it. However, MetaLab requires anyone who uses a dataset to cite the contributors of the dataset, even if there is no publication or pre-print yet. Citation that users should use are available in the &lt;a href=&#34;/documentation.html#datasets&#34;&gt;documentation of each dataset&lt;/a&gt;, potentially specifying « in preparation », and/or linking to an online repository (such as OSF). Note that we will update these entries as preprints and published papers become available. Learn more by reading our &lt;a href=&#34;/publications.html&#34;&gt;full citation policy&lt;/a&gt;.
Unpublished meta-analyses shared on MetaLab do not count as publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MetaLab is dynamic: Meta-analysis can be updated, adding new relevant studies when they are published. Contributors can retain control on this for as long as they want to. Two options exists for the curation and review of data. Contributors can choose to be the curator. This means a contributor agrees to be the person responsible for identifying new relevant papers and signaling them to the MetaLab data manager, who will add them to the database. Curators are expected to check the data entered regularly. Curators are part of the MetaLab team and can choose to join discussions regarding e.g. site revamping. Alternatively, contributors can choose to step down completely, and it will be MetaLab’s job to assign a new curator for such a dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;div id=&#34;what-are-effect-sizes&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What are effect sizes?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MAs (meta-analyses) we express the outcome of a single experiment in a way that captures how big an effect is and how much it varies. There are 3 groups of effect sizes:&lt;br /&gt;
1. effect sizes based on means, which includes Cohen’s &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; on which we focus from here on;&lt;br /&gt;
2. effect sizes based on binary data; and&lt;br /&gt;
3. effect sizes based on correlations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since most developmental studies in the lab use mean responses of two groups or of the same infant in two (or more) conditions, Cohen’s d is the appropriate effect size measure. This &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meta-analysis.com/downloads/Meta-analysis%20Choosing%20an%20effect%20size.pdf&#34;&gt;chapter 3&lt;/a&gt; and the following ones provide a gentle introduction to effect sizes. Cohen’s d is based on standardized mean differences. To get a feel for Cohen’s d we highly recommend to play with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rpsychologist.com/d3/cohend/&#34;&gt;visualization&lt;/a&gt; of RPsychologist. A list of recommended readings is also provided at the end of this document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a typical infant study, babies might hear two types of trials and the responses to each are compared. In most papers, it is sufficient that the difference between the trial types reaches statistical significance, but in a meta-analyses we care about the size of this single observed effect and its variance. This allows us to pool over several studies, weigh each datapoint, and arrive at an estimate of the underlying, true effect. This then allows us to calculate power and check how effect sizes might be systematically affected by variables such as infant age in “moderator analyses”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended further readings for an introduction to effect sizes&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Textbooks are great to get a basic overview of how to calculate effect sizes. We consulted: Lipsey, M. W. &amp;amp; Wilson, D. B. (2001). Practical meta-analysis. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A great primer and a spreadsheet document to calculate effect sizes by hand can be found via: D. Lakens. (2013). Calculating and Reporting Effect Sizes to Facilitate Cumulative Science: A Practical Primer for t-tests and ANOVAs . Frontiers in Psychology 4:863. &lt;a href=&#34;osf.io/ixgcd/files/&#34;&gt;Materials on OSF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since textbooks do not cover every possible question that different meta-analysts may encounter, we turned to articles for more specific questions. We found this article useful for considering the comparability of effect sizes from within- and between-participant designs: Morris, S. B., &amp;amp; DeShon, R. P. (2002). Combining Effect Size Estimates in Meta-Analysis With Repeated Measures and Independent-Groups Designs. Psychological Methods, 7(1), 1805-125. doi: 10.1037//1082-989X.7.1.105&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Borenstein, M., Hedges, L. V. ,Higgins, J. P. T., Rothstein, H. R. (2009). Introduction to Meta-Analysis. John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons. DOI: 10.1002/9780470743386.ch3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;div id=&#34;how-do-i-select-the-studies-to-include&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How do I select the studies to include?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/W3LMs-XY21g&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this step is to put together a list of publications that you
will look at and consider for inclusion. In a typical MA, you make the
most comprehensive list possible in order to answer a specific research
question and/or to cover a given phenomenon. This typically means going
through 1,000 abstracts, and reading in full 100 papers.
You can start with the seminal paper for your effect of interest, and then look for the studies citing your seminal one. Use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/advanced&#34;&gt;pubmed’s search&lt;/a&gt; to find your pivot study’s entry, for instance by copy-pasting the full paper title in the builder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;media/pubmed_advanced_search.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:5in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you press “search”, usually you’ll find the entry for your seminal paper (or if the title was not unique, you might need to click on one of the entries found until you do come across the entry for your seminal paper). Notice on the right a section entitled “Cited by …” Scroll down to click on the link at the bottom of this section stating “See all..”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;media/pubmed_citing_papers.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:5in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will now see all studies citing your seminal one. Constrain it further by clicking on “Show additional filters” on the left, and checking the box for “Infant: birth to 23 months”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;media/links_from_pubmed.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:5in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now want to save all these papers in your reference management software.
If you use Zotero: Click on the drawing of a folder in your status/search bar. When you do so, a window will pop up with all the results for that pubmed page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;media/save2Zotero.jpg&#34; style=&#34;width:5in&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on “select all” and “OK”. Repeat for the other search pages. This will store the citation information, including abstract, in zotero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also interrogate Pubmed with a script, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/mcfrank/c1ec74df1427278cbe53&#34;&gt;the one we have prepared&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-exactly-can-i-go-about-looking-through-my-initial-list-and-making-decisions&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How exactly can I go about looking through my initial list and making decisions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zBn83RQlo-c&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if the title and abstract doesn’t allow me to decide?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then play it safe and include the paper to check based on the full text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if the title and abstract doesn’t allow me to decide, but in
fact I know the paper and I know it needs to be excluded?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you probably have already seen the full text of the paper, so say
“yes” for the screening decision, and then “no” for the full-text
decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-many-papers-should-i-enter&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How many papers should I enter?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you would enter everything: published or unpublished, proceedings or journal, etc. However, sometimes you may want to start a “seed” meta-analysis that just gives a rough idea of an area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, how large should your sample be? Mika and Molly have done some &lt;a href=&#34;https://rawgit.com/langcog/metalab/master/resampling/resampling.html&#34;&gt;simulations&lt;/a&gt; to help you decide. By and large, it looks like the more, the better – clearly estimates get more precise (confidence intervals narrow) as more papers are entered. Based on this information, we are proposing &lt;em&gt;a minimum of 10 included experiments&lt;/em&gt; as a pragmatic first step, knowing that your estimate is not very precise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script src=&#34;/rmarkdown-libs/header-attrs/header-attrs.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;div id=&#34;how-should-i-structure-the-data-for-my-meta-analysis&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How should I structure the data for my meta-analysis?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are hoping that eventually all of your MAs (meta-analyses) will be included in
&lt;a href=&#34;.&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;MetaLab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so we ask you to use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Y_2BcFSu48t0F8a_xrY1Ro2fJoCIV1h8O627WNcrjY/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;MA
template&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
(create a copy), and follow the &lt;a href=&#34;/documentation.html#field_specs&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;field specifications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to ensure compatibility. (Note that right now, winter 2018, these specifications are biased towards language acquisition research. If you work on another topic, we would be thrilled if you helped us expand and adapt MetaLab).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you would code all potentially relevant moderator variables
(e.g., experimental manipulations) in addition to the core
characteristics (columns in red; e.g., number of participants). However, in the interest
of time, you can get started with the core characteristics only.
Remember once more to give us viewing rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-are-the-relevant-variables-for-a-ma-and-how-many-input-rowscolumns-should-i-make&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are the relevant variables for a MA, and how many input rows/columns should I make?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/spge3nZqCng&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of my papers has a single experiment but involves both Spanish and English speakers who are tested on a native and a nonnative speech sound contrast. Should that count as 4 experiments (2 languages x 2 contrasts)?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many rows you make depends on how the results are reported. In this case, the authors report the outcome separately for all four groups. Therefore, please enter the four groups separately; each into their own row. You can copy over descriptions of the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Experiment 1, there are two age groups. Do I have to report the age for both groups or do I average both groups into one? If I have to report both groups, how do I report this in the input form?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many rows you make depends on how the results are reported. In this case, the authors report an average outcome over both age groups, since they did not find a significant difference between the two groups. Therefore, please enter only one row and calculate the average age. If the results were reported separately per age group, make a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-do-i-retrieve-studies&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do I retrieve studies?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a typical full MA, you go through the whole list and only then start
entering. The procedure is as follows. Go back to your spreadsheet, and
for each study that has been decided as a “yes” during screening, try to
retrieve the full text for the paper as you normally would (e.g., search
through scholar.google.com; regular google; your institution’s library,
etc.) If you cannot retrieve it, update your spreadsheet sheet
Relevant_studies_search to mark this paper as “no” in column F
entitled “Fulltext_retrieved”. If you want, you can contact the authors
to try to get the full text from them, in which case you can note this
on column G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do find the full text, go through the paper to find the first
experiment reported. You will enter all experiments and conditions one
at a time, and fill in their information in the MA spreadsheet you
created in step 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How do I enter and code relevant studies?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ5m5YZE57M&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT: You should work backwards from the &lt;strong&gt;results&lt;/strong&gt; section: look
at what dependent measures are reported fully enough that you will be
able to extract an effect size from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following information
allows one to calculate an effect size (we are sticking to experimental
designs, since most of our MAs are experimental):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;between-participant studies&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Means and SDs (not SEs!) of the dependent variable for each infant group are all that is required for the calculation of Cohen’s &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes, means and SDs are not available as numbers. If there are clear figures, you can try to estimate means and SDs using &lt;a href=&#34;http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;this online app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13118&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the R package metaDigitise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you decide to estimate values from figures, add a column to keep track of this. Finally, &lt;strong&gt;t or F values for the &lt;em&gt;main&lt;/em&gt; effect in combination with sample sizes&lt;/strong&gt; can be used to calculate Cohen’s &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;. Note them when available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;within-participant studies&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Effect sizes for this type of study are calculated the &lt;strong&gt;same way as in between-participant studies&lt;/strong&gt;, but in order to calculate the weight of these studies the &lt;strong&gt;correlation&lt;/strong&gt; between the first and second measurements is required (to account for the amount of within-participant variation). Since this measure is usually not reported, we provide below median and range for correlations found in existing MAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infant word segmentation from native speech: 0.641 (range: 0.140 to 0.921)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infant vowel discrimination (native and nonnative): 0.496 (range: -0.413 to 0.855)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When entering papers, please remember a key thing: all analyses are done
by machines, and machines cannot read text! So if a column is “numeric”,
please do &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; enter things that aren’t numbers (such as text,
spaces, ~, etc). This is particularly important for the dependent
measures!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this stage, you might find that a given paper does not contain the
right information for being included. In this case, you can and should
exclude it. If you have already started entering it, you can leave the
information you entered and put in “comments” that the entry is
incomplete (although if you followed our advice above, you won’t have
wasted time entering it!). Remember to update your spreadsheet with each
paper you read and made a decision on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The article I enter has 3 experiments, and the first is with adult participants. Do I need to enter this experiment?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, please only enter the infant/child experiments&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-level-of-detail-should-i-report&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What level of detail should I report?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sound stimuli differ approx. 6 ms in length, but the experiment is not about length differences. Do I have to report this difference although it is very small?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case there’s a column for stimulus length, please report it. You are right that this experiment is not about length differences, but having the information cannot hurt, and eventual analyses will reflect that the difference is very small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The article reports a table with the lengths of each individual stimulus. Should I calculate and report the average value?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, please report the averaged value in the appropriate column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am entering an article with the HAS method. The authors report results for both the 2 and 4 minutes after the test phase has started. Your example only reports the results after 2 minutes, but would you still want me to report both?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is often the case that articles report more than one type of result. Please just report the ones that we also provide in the example file!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How do I calculate Effect Sizes?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WDxA8TfU1sk&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use R to calculate effect sizes. Visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/langcog/metalab2/tree/master/scripts&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://github.com/langcog/metalab2/tree/master/scripts&lt;/a&gt; for our code.
The metafor package also includes functions to compute the observed effect sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recommend the following for an introduction to effect sizes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&#34;list-style-type: decimal&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Textbooks are great to get a basic overview of how to calculate
effect sizes. We consulted: Lipsey, M. W. &amp;amp; Wilson, D. B. (2001).
Practical meta-analysis. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great primer and a spreadsheet document to calculate effect sizes
by hand can be found via: D. Lakens. (2013). Calculating and Reporting
Effect Sizes to Facilitate Cumulative Science: A Practical Primer for
t-tests and ANOVAs . Frontiers in Psychology 4:863. &lt;a href=&#34;https://osf.io/ixgcd/files/&#34;&gt;Materials on OSF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since textbooks do not cover every possible question that different
meta-analysts may encounter, we turned to articles for more specific
questions. We found this article useful for considering the
comparability of effect sizes from within- and between-participant
designs: Morris, S. B., &amp;amp; DeShon, R. P. (2002). Combining Effect Size
Estimates in Meta-Analysis With Repeated Measures and Independent-Groups
Designs. Psychological Methods, 7(1), 1805-125. doi:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//1082-989X.7.1.105&#34;&gt;10.1037//1082-989X.7.1.105&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What if I don’t have all the required information?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two groups of infants are tested and I treat them as two different entries, but the number of included and excluded infants are only reported as a whole over both groups. What do I do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the best approximation we can get, please divide the reported number through the number of groups (in your case 2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The age of infants is reported in weeks, therefore I multiplied it with 7 to convert it into days. I read in your instructions that you have to multiply months with 30.42 to get a proxy for days. So my question is whether I have to multiply with a different number than 7 to get a proxy for days?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, that’s fine the way you did it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases you will still need to contact the authors of the study. People probably don’t know you, so think about what in the object would make you open an email from a stranger. Something like “including your paper in a MA” should be motivational. People are busy: they don’t have time to read lengthy email, especially from someone they don’t know, so be as concise as possible. You could still give them more details later if they ask for it. Don’t be shy, authors are likely to be happy to hear that someone is interested in their work and is going to cite them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&#34;why-meta-analysis-ma&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Why meta-analysis (MA)?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a quick overview on what are meta-analysis (MA), please watch this 3-minute video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Omnq13QZ-3c&#34; width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meta-analyses (MAs) can be useful several purposes, including: (1) &lt;em&gt;theory building and evaluation&lt;/em&gt; and (2) &lt;em&gt;practical decisions during study design&lt;/em&gt;. This section starts with some basics on why MAs are more useful than single studies for those two purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;why-are-single-studies-not-enough&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why are single studies not enough?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When thinking about development, we often look at published experiments testing whether infants have specific abilities, for example whether infants treat native vowels differently from non-native ones, and how those abilities change with age (for more details on this specific topic see [here] (/dataset/inphondb-native.html).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of a single experiment cannot answer those questions once and for all: Each experiment measures behavior of a set of infants in a very specific situation, which might not be generalizable to other situations. Moreover, there might be a measurement error in this one-time snapshot of reality. Finally, the literature likely contains some false positives and false negatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a significance threshold alpha set to .05, every study we run has a 5% chance of telling us that infants can do something when this is not true - this is a &lt;em&gt;false positive&lt;/em&gt;. This likelihood becomes bigger when researchers engage in seemingly innocent and possibly common practices that increase the chance of a false positive, such as running multiple analyses until one is significant. Some people even propose that most published literature consists of false positives!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a beta set to .2, every study we run has a 20% chance of telling us that infants cannot do something when they actually can - this is a &lt;em&gt;false negative&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, many studies are underpowered, so that a non-significant result is not due to a true lack of effect, but rather to lack of power to detect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these necessarily are due to bad intentions, wrongdoing, or even poor research practices. Reality is complex and thus any one study can only give us a single, noisy estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-can-mas-help-with-heterogeneity&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How can MAs help with heterogeneity?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAs may be the cheapest way to assess generalizability and test whether a certain factor matters. Instead of running 10 experiments, 1 on each vowel contrast, we collect 10 studies in the literature into a single analysis! If effects for e.g. native versus non-native vowels differ significantly in the literature as a whole, then we can be more confident that results will generalize to unobserved vowel contrasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-can-mas-help-with-false-positives&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How can MAs help with false positives?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collecting many study results from different researchers is a way to try and make up for the possibility that biases influenced the outcome. We can even &lt;em&gt;use MAs to check for biases&lt;/em&gt;, such as asking whether a suspicious number of p-values is just below the significance threshold or whether results are systematically skewed in one direction. Why biases matter is wonderfully illustrated here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.alltrials.net/news/the-economist-publication-bias/&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;http://www.alltrials.net/news/the-economist-publication-bias/&lt;/a&gt;. Checking for biased results is a whole literature on its own, but as a start tools such as p-curving apps are easily available for every researcher. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.p-curve.com/&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;http://www.p-curve.com/&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://shinyapps.org/apps/p-checker/&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;http://shinyapps.org/apps/p-checker/&lt;/a&gt; are two well-documented examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;how-can-mas-help-with-false-negatives&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How can MAs help with false negatives?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MAs help in 3 ways. By pooling data together, we may be able to &lt;em&gt;bring out a small effect&lt;/em&gt; that was too difficult to detect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we often do not know about these non-significant findings because it is quite difficult to publish them. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26186116&#34;&gt;Community-augmented MAs&lt;/a&gt; like those in MetaLab provide a home for &lt;em&gt;non-sexy results&lt;/em&gt;, and allow researchers to benefit from the experience of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, MAs help us in experiment design so we can &lt;em&gt;avoid false negatives due to low power&lt;/em&gt;. When the size of an effect is known and with a fixed significance threshold, calculating power is straightforward. Here is a simulation of how all ingredients fit together: &amp;lt;rpsychologist.com/d3/NHST/&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;can-mas-help-in-other-ways&#34; class=&#34;section level4&#34;&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Can MAs help in other ways?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MAs in MetaLab can also help with &lt;em&gt;study design&lt;/em&gt;, becodes often many design variables have been coded. Examples include the words or sounds used, how long trials were, etc. Instead of doing a tiresome literature review, you can find out what is the most common procedure or which is associated with the biggest effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
