<h3>How do I define my MA question?</h3>

<p>Choose the appropriate level of detail for your MA topic. The topic of your meta-analysis should be broader than the one of a single experiment (e.g. “How do babies segment words of different stress patterns?”), but narrower than a whole research field (e.g. “How do babies learn language?”). The goal is to be able to gather comparable papers, measuring consistant dependant variables, to allow you to compute a common statistical metric (i.e. effect size) from them.</p>
<p>Define your population of interest precisely. Homogeneous can mean many things; age, language, typical versus atypical. You may run a meta-analysis where you accept many different levels for some of the variables and see how it affects results, defining them as MA moderators, for example seeing if effects are consistent across ages. There should still be some unifying element in your studies though so you have one broad result of your meta-analysis.</p>
<p>Consider the number of available studies on your topic. Your MA topic also depends on how many studies have been done on it. If you want to run a simple comparative MA, as few as two studies could be okay. But if you want to run an analysis with a lot of moderators, 5 studies probably isn’t enough to warrant a meta-analysis.</p>

<h3>Why should I bother keeping track of the MA creation process?</h3>

<p>It is important that you build traceability of your work from the start,
particularly since in larger MAs other people may finish up the
work or you want to check later on why you decided to exclude a given
paper. So to make sure that all of your decisions are recorded and
clear, make a copy of this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mtN4g6FddpBljQzrR-mS0y414M9wQNjK4Vz09nLOe2s/edit#gid=0"><em>decision
spreadsheet</em></a>.
Don’t forget to rename it, to give us a “viewing” link, and clean it up
as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Click on “File” and select the “Make a copy…” option</p>
<p><img src="media/image04.jpg" style="width:5in" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: In the window that appears, change the name to something like
“MA_TOPIC”</p>
<p><img src="media/image03.jpg" style="width:5in" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click on the blue button “Share” on the top right.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: In the menu, click on “Get shareable link” on the top
right</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Copy the link and send it to us.</p>
<p><img src="media/image05.jpg" style="width:5in" /></p>
<p>Step 6: Clean up</p>
<p>The model spreadsheet contains some fake entries and notes. Our
recommendation is, so as not to get confused, to remove the instructions
found on the top lines of each sheet and the fake information that is
already entered - except for a couple of exceptions: the pink columns
(A, B and W) in the Relevant_studies_search sheet contain formulas
that may be useful to you. So you might want to delete the contents of
the other columns and keep those two in order to reuse the formulas.</p>
<p>************</p>
<p>Additionally, make a copy of <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DKY8BTZZ82bGyGwpGsyyzsilOqE1F1NcDLTKWtCe9AY/edit?usp=sharing"><em>this
flowchart</em></a>,
rename and share as you did for your spreadsheet above. This figure
gives you an overview of the process, and you will be filling in the
boxes with the right numbers as you go along so that people who continue
this MA and/or those interested in assessing this work can make sure
that you followed the procedure.</p>

<div id="now-that-i-have-my-list-of-related-studies-how-do-i-set-my-inclusion-criteria" class="section level3">
<h3>Now that I have my list of related studies, how do I set my inclusion criteria?</h3>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gk3GHT_eEI8" width="420" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<p>Probably not. In this step, you will go through the initial list you put together in
step 2, and make decisions to include/exclude papers, mostly based on
the abstract. In addition to creating your sample for data entry (step
4) you will start honing your <em>inclusion criteria</em>. Typically, these
will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>a homogeneous scientific question</strong>:
&gt; Make sure you have clearly
&gt; defined the purview of e.g. cross-situational learning (e.g., this
&gt; name itself is vague to those outside the domain, so define it in
&gt; a more specific way: “exposure to sets of images paired with
&gt; wordforms with the goal of studying word-form image association,
&gt; but crucially multiple images are shown at once (unlike e.g. the
&gt; switch procedure)”)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>a homogeneous infant population</strong>:
&gt; Typically-developing children,
&gt; between the ages of XX and YY (the precise ages may stem from your
&gt; seminal paper; perhaps to start with, you could set the maximum to
&gt; 36 months, the minimum to 0 months); consider whether you also
&gt; need to restrict the sample based on infants’ native language <em>on
&gt; theoretical reasons</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is perhaps the trickiest. Staying close to your seminal
paper will allow you to reduce the amount of variation in your sample
due to methodological “details”, and to make it easier for yourself to
enter data, because all the results will be structured in similar ways.
But it’s important to know that this is a potential source of bias. For
instance, you could decide that you will only input data using a
specific kind of artificial language because you know that papers not
using this language have smaller effects. This will end up being a
self-confirmation exercise – unless there are a priori strong
theoretical reasons to exclude other kinds of language or to assume
that the learning mechanisms attributed to the infant cannot be
generalized to these other languages.</p>
<p>Every time you make a decision regarding these and other key criteria,
remember to note it in your decision spreadsheet, in the last sheet
called “Notes_inclusion”. For example, mine looks like this:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="19%" />
<col width="74%" />
<col width="6%" />
</colgroup>

<tr class="header">
