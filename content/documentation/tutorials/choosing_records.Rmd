How do I select the studies to include?
==============================
```{r libraries, include=FALSE}
library("htmltools")
library("vembedr")
```

```{r video 1, echo = FALSE}

```

The goal of this step is to put together a list of publications that you
will look at and consider for inclusion. In a typical MA, you make the
most comprehensive list possible in order to answer a specific research
question and/or to cover a given phenomenon. This typically means going
through 1,000 abstracts, and reading in full 100 papers.
You can start with the seminal paper for your effect of interest, and then look for the studies citing your seminal one. Use [pubmed’s search](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/advanced) to find your pivot study’s entry, for instance by copy-pasting the full paper title in the builder:

![](media/pubmed_advanced_search.jpg){width="5in"}

When you press “search”, usually you’ll find the entry for your seminal paper (or if the title was not unique, you might need to click on one of the entries found until you do come across the entry for your seminal paper). Notice on the right a section entitled “Cited by …” Scroll down to click on the link at the bottom of this section stating “See all..”

![](media/pubmed_citing_papers.jpg){width="5in"}

You will now see all studies citing your seminal one. Constrain it further by clicking on “Show additional filters” on the left, and checking the box for “Infant: birth to 23 months”:

![](media/links_from_pubmed.jpg){width="5in"}

You now want to save all these papers in your reference management software. 
	If you use Zotero: Click on the drawing of a folder in your status/search bar. When you do so, a window will pop up with all the results for that pubmed page:
	
![](media/save2Zotero.jpg){width="5in"}

Click on “select all” and “OK”. Repeat for the other search pages. This will store the citation information, including abstract, in zotero.

You can also interrogate Pubmed with a script, such as [the one we have prepared](https://gist.github.com/mcfrank/c1ec74df1427278cbe53).


### How exactly can I go about looking through my initial list and making decisions?
```{r video 2, echo = FALSE}
embed_url("https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=zBn83RQlo-c")
```

***What if the title and abstract doesn’t allow me to decide?***

Then play it safe and include the paper to check based on the full text.

***What if the title and abstract doesn’t allow me to decide, but in
fact I know the paper and I know it needs to be excluded?***

Then you probably have already seen the full text of the paper, so say
“yes” for the screening decision, and then “no” for the full-text
decision.

### How many papers should I enter?
Ideally, you would enter everything: published or unpublished, proceedings or journal, etc. However, sometimes you may want to start a “seed” meta-analysis that just gives a rough idea of an area. 

In this case, how large should your sample be? Mika and Molly have done some [simulations](https://rawgit.com/langcog/metalab/master/resampling/resampling.html) to help you decide. By and large, it looks like the more, the better -- clearly estimates get more precise (confidence intervals narrow) as more papers are entered. Based on this information, we are proposing _a minimum of 10 included experiments_ as a pragmatic first step, knowing that your estimate is not very precise.
